# Standalone Cache Building Update

## Overview
Updated all Enhanced CLIP scripts to include standalone cache building functionality. Previously, these scripts depended on `.instance_cache.pkl` from deleted helper scripts. Now they can generate the cache automatically if it doesn't exist.

## Changes Made

### 1. `build_enhanced_codebook.py` (v1)
**Added:**
- `build_instance_cache()` function that scans all JSON files and builds `{instance_id: [(json_path, bbox_idx), ...]}` mapping

**Modified:**
- `main()` function now has smart cache loading:
  - If `.instance_cache.pkl` exists → load it
  - If not exists → build from JSON files automatically
  - Save cache after building for future use

**Benefits:**
- Fully standalone - can run without any prerequisites
- Builds cache only once (first run)
- Subsequent runs use cached data (much faster)

### 2. `build_enhanced_codebook_v2.py` (v2 with hierarchical classification)
**Added:**
- Same `build_instance_cache()` function
- Same smart cache loading in `main()`

**Benefits:**
- Same standalone capabilities as v1
- No dependency on deleted helper scripts
- Consistent behavior across both versions

### 3. `visualize_enhanced_results.py`
**Added:**
- `build_instance_cache()` function
- Smart cache loading in `load_data()`

**Benefits:**
- Can run independently even if cache doesn't exist
- Automatically builds cache when needed
- Shows progress bar during cache building

## Cache Structure

The `.instance_cache.pkl` file contains:

```python
{
    'instance_locations': {
        instance_id: [(json_path, bbox_idx), ...],
        # Example: 18: [(Path('processed_data/taskonomy/ackermanville/point_0_view_0_domain_rgb.json'), 3)]
    },
    'total_files': 3862  # Total JSON files scanned
}
```

## Usage

All three scripts now work the same way:

```bash
# First run - builds cache automatically
python build_enhanced_codebook.py
# Output: "Cache not found, building from JSON files..."
#         "Found 3862 JSON files to scan"
#         "✅ Found 253 unique instances"
#         "💾 Saved cache to .instance_cache.pkl"

# Subsequent runs - loads cached data
python build_enhanced_codebook.py
# Output: "Loading instance cache from ..."
#         "✅ Loaded 253 instances from cache"
```

## Performance

**First Run (with cache building):**
- Scans all JSON files: ~30-60 seconds for 3,862 files
- Saves cache for future use
- Proceeds with classification

**Subsequent Runs (with cache):**
- Loads cache instantly: < 1 second
- Skips JSON scanning entirely

## Cache Invalidation

If you want to rebuild the cache (e.g., after adding new JSON files):

```bash
# Delete the cache file
rm processed_data/taskonomy/.instance_cache.pkl

# Run any script - cache will be rebuilt
python build_enhanced_codebook_v2.py
```

## Technical Details

### Cache Building Process

1. **Scan Phase:** Iterate through all `**/*.json` files in `processed_data/taskonomy/`
2. **Extract Phase:** For each JSON file:
   - Read `bounding_boxes_3d` array
   - Extract instance ID from `category` field (e.g., `"object_18"` → `18`)
   - Record location: `(json_path, bbox_idx)`
3. **Aggregate Phase:** Build dictionary mapping instance IDs to all their locations
4. **Save Phase:** Pickle the mapping to `.instance_cache.pkl`

### Cache Statistics

After building, the function logs:
- Total unique instances found
- Min/max/avg locations per instance
- Example: "Avg locations per instance: 15.3" means each object appears in ~15 different views

## Migration Notes

**Old Behavior (before this update):**
```python
if cache_path.exists():
    load_cache()
else:
    logger.error("❌ No cache found. Run build_label_codebook_fast.py first")
    return  # Script exits!
```

**New Behavior (after this update):**
```python
if cache_path.exists():
    load_cache()
else:
    logger.info("Cache not found, building from JSON files...")
    cache = build_instance_cache(processed_dir)
    save_cache(cache)
    # Script continues!
```

## Compatibility

✅ **Backward Compatible:** If `.instance_cache.pkl` already exists, scripts load it directly (no changes in behavior)

✅ **Forward Compatible:** New cache format includes metadata (`total_files`) for future extensibility

✅ **Cross-Version Compatible:** Cache built by v1 works with v2 and vice versa (same format)

## Summary

All three scripts (`build_enhanced_codebook.py`, `build_enhanced_codebook_v2.py`, `visualize_enhanced_results.py`) are now **fully standalone**:

- ✅ No dependency on deleted helper scripts
- ✅ Automatic cache building on first run
- ✅ Fast cache loading on subsequent runs
- ✅ Clear progress indicators during cache building
- ✅ Statistics logging for transparency

Users can now run any of these scripts without worrying about pre-generating caches or running helper scripts first.
