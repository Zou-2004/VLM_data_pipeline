# Data Processing Updates Summary

## Files Modified/Created for GitHub Update

### 1. Data Processing Directory (`data_processing/`)

#### Modified Files:
- **`sunrgbd_processor.py`** 
  - ✅ **COMMITTED** - Added extrinsics loading functionality
  - Added `load_extrinsics()` function to parse camera extrinsics from timestamp files
  - Support for both 3x4 and 4x4 extrinsics matrix formats
  - Automatic selection of most recent timestamp file when multiple exist
  - Enhanced `process_scene()` to include actual extrinsics data instead of None
  - Improves QA generation with proper spatial positioning data

- **`coco_processor.py`**
  - ✅ **COMMITTED** - Fixed error handling for missing labels.json
  - Changed error to warning when labels.json not found in train split
  - Improved `process_all()` to check for valid splits before processing
  - Added `processed_splits` to summary for better tracking
  - Handle missing annotation files gracefully

### 2. Dataset Downloaders Directory (`dataset_downloaders/`)

#### Status:
- ❌ **NO CHANGES** - All files in `dataset_downloaders/` are unchanged
- No modifications were made to any downloader scripts during our QA enhancement work

## Commit Status

```bash
# Successfully committed on 2025-10-23
git commit cd994aa - "fix(data_processing): improve error handling and robustness"
```

## Changes Summary:
- **Files in data_processing/**: 2 modified (committed)
- **Files in dataset_downloaders/**: 0 modified  
- **Total changes ready for GitHub**: 2 files committed locally

## Issues Encountered:
- ✅ COCO processor bug fixed (missing train/labels.json handling)
- ✅ SUNRGBD processor enhanced with extrinsics support
- ⚠️ Git push failed due to:
  1. Disk space full on root filesystem (100% used)
  2. Authentication credential writing failure

## Next Steps:
To successfully push to GitHub, resolve the disk space issue on the root filesystem or use alternative authentication method (SSH keys, personal access token via command line, etc.).

## Code Quality:
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Enhanced error handling and robustness
- Proper logging and warning messages
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
